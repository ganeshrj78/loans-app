# Small businesses Loans

This app is meant to demo multi-tenant deployment scenarios using Apache Knox

The application is a fairly contrived one where multiple lending institutions use the application as a
portal for originators to use to submit loan applications for small businesses.

The application itself is written in golang and uses Apache Knox in the following ways:

1. To proxy the UI of the application
2. To provide the SSO capabilities
3. To be the reverse proxy to the Hadoop cluster


# Setup

The demo setup expects to run on a laptop all locally (with one or more VMs and or docker containers).

To be able to simulate multiple domains the following is needed in the /etc/hosts file

127.0.0.1 www.unwise.com

127.0.0.1 www.goodloans.com

These two domains will be the two tenants of the application.

The topology files under /knox-files in this repo should be deployed to a knox instance.

The URLs to get to the app are therefore :

https://www.goodloans.com:8443/gateway/goodloans/loans/

and 

https://www.unwise.com:8443/gateway/unwise/loans/

The topology files assume a Hadoop cluster running on an Ambari Vagrant machine c6401.ambari.apache.org

The following setup is needed on that VM:

1. Add users and groups for the tenants

 groupadd loanscore

 useradd loanscore -g loanscore
 
 groupadd unwise

 useradd unwise -g unwise

 useradd bob_unwise -g unwise

 groupadd goodloans

 useradd goodloans -g goodloans

 useradd bob_goodloans -g goodloans

2. Add the originator users to the tenant groups

usermod -a -G unwise guest

usermod -a -G goodloans guest

3. Create the folders for the tenants

hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /unwise/applications

hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /goodloans/applications

hdfs dfs -chmod 775 /unwise/applications

hdfs dfs -chmod 775 /goodloans/applications

hdfs dfs -chown -R loanscore:unwise /unwise

hdfs dfs -chown -R loanscore:goodloans /goodloans
